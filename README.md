# HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION
This project involves predicting house prices using various machine learning algorithms, all implemented from scratch without relying on external libraries. It served as a significant undertaking during my university studies, showcasing my ability to develop and apply machine learning techniques independently.I utilized the California dataset as the foundation for my project.
