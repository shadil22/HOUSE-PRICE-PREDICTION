# HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch, without relying on external libraries. It was a significant undertaking during university studies, demonstrating the ability to develop and apply machine learning techniques independently. The California dataset served as the foundation for this project.

Files Included:
README.md - Project overview.
housing.csv - Dataset used for analysis.
my_final_project_report.pdf - Detailed report of the project.
project_final_code (1).ipynb - Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation.

Key Features:
Independent Implementation: All machine learning algorithms were built from scratch.
Focus on Learning: Showcases understanding of core ML concepts without external dependencies.
California Dataset: Utilized for analysis and predictions.
This project highlights hands-on experience in machine learning and data analysis, emphasizing self-reliance and problem-solving skills.
